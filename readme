Works with Windows + linux.
Compile with Lasarus / FPC.
Install Indy https://www.indyproject.org/
For Linux, set ports > 1024 if not running as root

This program will take the bridgecommand-bc UDP output and makes it accessible in two formats, a text file and from a simple HTML server.

The format is 6 lines of NEMA text.
Data is updated as set in the program. 
bridgecommand-bc sends 6 lines of UDP NEMA text at 250 ms intervals (between each line)

I am using this to allow web browsers to read this NEMA text and to also display it in an instument format using HTML, images, and JavaScript.
Easy to modify and design.
No need to compile for an OS.

It is hoped that this might be built into future bridgecommand-bc versions. 

If fancy graphics are required, webgl or some clever application of images and jquey rotate modules might be used. http://jqueryrotate.com/
