I intend to find a cross platform way to save the output that is sent to UDP ports to a local text file which will be updated at a sufficiently high rate).
The intent is to be able to feed the required data to a web browser which will be coded in JS to act as any sort of instrument easily across almost all platforms.
There would be no need to compile instruments for different platforms.
The JS code will be loading the text file on a frequent basis using AJAX calls.
The text file would best be saved in JSON format if possible.
If fancy graphics are required, webgl or some clever application of images and jquey rotate modules might be used. http://jqueryrotate.com/
If another PC terminal requires access to this text file, local file sharing would be enabled, and the path be set (in the browser).
