Demo at: https://www.emogic.com/bc/

How to use: 
Zip and download this complete git. Unzip it. 
Run BridgeCommandNEMAUDPtoFileandHTML.exe 
Open JS_Instrumentation_Demo.html in a browser and choose file (point to NEMA.txt), or http option 
Run bridgecommander-bc.exe (https://www.bridgecommand.co.uk/). 

------------------------------------------------------

BridgeCommandNEMAUDPtoFileandHTML will compile with and works in Windows and Linux and Raspbian.
Compile with Lazarus / Free Pascal. https://www.lazarus-ide.org/ https://www.freepascal.org/
Install Indy https://www.indyproject.org/
Note: For Linux, set ports > 1024 if not running as root

JS_Instrumentation_Demo.html is tested in Chrome and Firefox, and occasionally in IE.

BridgeCommandNEMAUDPtoFileandHTML.exe will take the bridgecommand-bc UDP NEMA output and saves it as NEMA.txt and also outputs it using a simple HTTP server (ports 80, 8080 (for linux) and 443)

bridgecommand-bc sends one line of UDP NEMA text at 250 ms intervals.
bridgecommand-bc provides the following NEMA output: $GPRMC , $GPGLL ,$GPGGA , $IIRSA ,$IIRPM , $IIRPM

The BridgeCommandNEMAUDPtoFileandHTML.exe output is intended to be used for web pages like JS_Instrumentation_Demo.html which will 
take the NEMA data and display it on instrumentation based on HTML, IMG and JavaScript technologies.
Instramuntation can be built using webgl or some clever application of images, video or jquey rotate modules. http://jqueryrotate.com/
No third party programs are needed and it is cross platform compatable.

It is hoped that this NEMA.txt and HTML output might be built into future bridgecommand-bc versions. 
I have modified the bridgecommand-bc NEMA.cpp code if you want to compile it into your version of bridgecommand. See : https://github.com/vpelss/BridgeCommand_NEMA_UDP_to_File_HTML/tree/master/Alternate_NEMA
BridgeCommand_NEMA_UDP_to_File_HTML.exe can always be used.

A status of V means the GPS has a valid fix that is below an internal quality threshold, e.g. because the dilution of precision is too high or an elevation mask test failed.
